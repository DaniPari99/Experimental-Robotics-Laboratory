The assignment involves a robot deployed in a indoor environment for surveillance purposes. The robotâ€™s objective is to visit the different locations and stay there for some times.
## The environment
The environment is shown in the following figure:

This is the 2D environment made of 4 rooms and 3 corridors.
The robot starts in the E location and waits until it receives the information to build the topological map,
i.e., the relations between C1, C2, R1, R2, R3 locations and the doors D1...D6.

Develop a Finite State Machine based on the SMACH library which represents the robot motion in the environment by respecting the above specifications.
